# Physical-Layout-Design
Complete design of USART interface with baud rate selection
- This is a group project submitted by me along with Akash Tadmare as a part of our Advanced VLSI course.
- The report file gives an overview of the USART protocol and covers the coplete design flow.
- The usart_tx.v and usart_rx.v are the verilog descriptions for USART transmitter and receiver.
